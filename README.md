# Optics

This is a program I built for an optics project at LeTourneau University. The basic idea behind the project is as follows.

Consider two mirrors facing each other, perfectly parallel. When an object is placed between them, an infinite number of refelctions are created, due the light repeatedly bouncing back and forth between the mirrors. However, when the mirror angles are ofset by even a faction of a degree, the number of refelections generated immedietly becomes finite and calculatable. The goal of this project is to derive a formula to calculate the number of generated images given the distance between the mirrors and the angle one mirror makes in respect to the other.

As it turns out, the distance between the mirrors is not a factor in regards to the number of images created. In fact, given an angle T, where T is the degree difference between the mirrors, the number of images created is simply:

n = 360 / T

Where n is the number of images.
